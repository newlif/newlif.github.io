<h2 style="page-break-before:always; margin-top:0;">B. Our distinctive beliefs at Newlife</h2>
<ul><li class="bluepoints">The purpose of the church is to make disciples and develop them to maturity
<ul><li>The church has a responsibility to recognize, train, mentor and give opportunity for the exercise of gifts</li>
<li>The church is also responsible to support and encourage character growth into the image of Christ</li></ul></li>
<li class="bluepoints">There are three aspects to the work of the Spirit
<ol type="A" style="list-style-type:upper-alpha;"><li>Love</li>
<li>Truth</li>
<li>Power</li></ol></li></ul>
<ol type="A" style="list-style-type:upper-alpha;"><li class="bluepoints">Love towards God, one another and the unsaved
<ul><li>Experiencing God’s love and loving him in return is at the heart of all we do</li>
<li>It is by our love for one another that the world knows we follow Jesus, and almost all the gifts are to be used in this context</li>
<li>We develop this by an extended time together on Sundays and meeting in homegroups and other events during the week</li>
<li>We are designed to be the primary manifestation of God’s love to a lost world</li></ul></li>
<li class="bluepoints">The truth keeps us on track and sets us free
<ul><li>In an age of confusion and deception among Christians, we have a high value on persuing a clear understanding of God’s truth, and being obedient to it</li>
<li>Our preaching, teaching and discussions take the Bible as God’s authoratitive word</li></ul></li>
<li class="bluepoints">Power
<ul><li>Every person has equal access to God and empowerment to pray, not two or more levels</li>
<li>The supernatural did not end in Acts, but is important for today</li>
<li>We look to see God move in power, both as an encouragement to us and as a witness to those outside</li>
<li>Every person’s gifts are needed, and are used primarily in the church community</li></ul></li></ol>
<ul><li class="bluepoints">Church Life
<ul><li>Baptism and Breaking Bread</li>
<li>Men and Women in God’s plan</li>
<li>Team leadership of the church</li></ul></li></ul>

<h2 style="page-break-before:always; margin-top:0;">C. Membership of the Newlife Church family</h2>
<ul><li class="bluepoints">What is a Church?
<ul><li>Not a building, or even a random collection of believers, but a family of Christians who put into practice the model that God has given us</li>
<li>God puts a very high value on church families, from the beginnng of Acts through to Jesus’s letters to the churches in Revelation</li>
<li>It is his primary tool for the extension of the kingdom and the demonstration of his love until he returns.</li></ul></li>
<li class="bluepoints">Why join the family?
<ul><li>Without some level of commitment, it is hard to truly function as a family.</li>
<li>This commitment forms the basis for accountability and development of giftings</li></ul></li>
<li class="bluepoints">Serving
<ul><li>There will be expectation and opportunity to serve for everyone, with flexibility for circumstances (e.g. new mothers)</li></ul></li>
<li class="bluepoints">Accountability
<ul><li>Commitment works both ways</li>
<li>If you are committed to us, you will...</li>
<li>Our commitment to you is to give you our attention in caring for your soul and developing you as a person</li>
<li>Mentorship: Meet at least once a month to talk about spiritual life</li></ul></li>
<li class="bluepoints">Homegroup
<ul><li>This is an important part of being a member</li>
<li>If there are practical issues, we want to do whatever we can to make this possible (noting that there might be some seasons where a full attendance is problematic)</li></ul></li>
<li class="bluepoints">Financial support
<ul><li>Whatever one’s income</li>
<li>Our position on tithing (not a legalistic 10%, but it’s a good starting point)</li></ul></li>
<li class="bluepoints">Process</li>
<li>One hour interview if you want to be a member where you will share testimony, the gospel, and what it means to be a member</li>
<li>If not baptized, then we would like to facilitate this</li>
<li>Welcomed in front of the church</li></ul>
