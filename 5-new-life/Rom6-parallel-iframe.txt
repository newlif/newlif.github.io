| 5 For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his [death], | we will certainly also be united in the likeness of his ^resurrection^. |
| 6 We know that our [old] man was [crucified] with him | so that the body of sin would ^no longer dominate^ us, so that we would ^no longer be enslaved^ to sin. |
| 7 (For someone who has [died] | has been ^freed from sin^.) |
| 8 Now if we [died] with Christ, | we believe that we will also ^live^ with him.*↓* |
| *↪*he is never going to [die] again; [death] no longer is his master.*↓* | 9 We know that since Christ has been ^raised from the dead^,*↩* |
| 10 For the [death he died], he [died] to [sin] once for all, | but the ^life^ he ^lives^, he ^lives^ to God. |
| 11 So you too consider yourselves [dead to sin], | but ^alive^ to ^God^ in Christ Jesus. |
| 12 Therefore do not let [sin] reign in your mortal body so that you obey its desires, 13 and do not present the members of your body to [sin] as instruments to be used for [unrighteousness], | but present yourselves to God as those who are ^alive from the dead^ and the members of your body to God as instruments to be used for ^righteousness^. |
| 14 For [sin] will not be your master, because you are [not under law] | but ^under grace^. |
