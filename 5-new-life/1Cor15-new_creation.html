<h1>New Life in Christ, renewed by the Spirit</h1>

<h3>— <em>1 Corinthians 15; Romans 6:5–14</em> — Andrew Fountain: June 9, 2019</h3>
<ul><li class="bluepoints">Today I want to explore:</li></ul>
<div class="slide"><h2>Explore:</h2>
<p>How being in the New Creation<br />
because we are united to Christ<br />
changes everything</p>
</div>
<ul><li>Get out metal and paper</li></ul>
<div class="slide"><h2>Recap</h2>
<ol type="1" style="list-style-type:decimal;"><li>What God is like</li>
<li>God and the Spirit World</li>
<li>How the World got Broken</li></ol>
</div>
<div class="slide"><h2>4. How the cross and resurrection changed everything</h2>
<ol type="1" style="list-style-type:decimal;"><li>Solution: The New Creation</li>
<li>How it works: Union with Christ Col 2:8–23</li>
<li>What this means for us</li></ol>
</div>
<div class="slide"><h2>5. New Life in Christ</h2>
<ol type="1" style="list-style-type:decimal;"><li>The Two Creations</li>
<li>Getting from the Old to the New</li>
<li>Living in the New</li></ol>
</div>
<div class="slide"><h2>Two Kinds of Stuff</h2>
<ol type="1" style="list-style-type:decimal;"><li>Things made out of paper, card, tape &amp; glue</li>
<li>Things made out of metal</li></ol>
<ul><li>Characteristics?</li>
<li>Can you turn something from card to metal?</li>
<li>How would you go about doing this?</li>
<li><em>So what was that all about Andrew?</em></li></ul>
</div>
<ol type="1" style="list-style-type:decimal;"><li class="bluepoints">Paper &amp; Card
<ul><li>does not last</li>
<li>easily damaged</li>
<li>not strong</li>
<li>can burn</li></ul></li>
<li class="bluepoints">Metal
<ul><li>lasts indefinitely</li>
<li>resists damage</li>
<li>very strong and functional</li>
<li>cannot burn</li></ul></li></ol>
<ul><li class="bluepoints">No you can’t!
<ul><li>Have to start again and copy it</li></ul></li>
<li class="bluepoints">So what is that all about</li></ul>
<div class="slide"><h2>Problem at Corinth</h2>
<ul><li>There was a problem that some people at the Corinthian church were laughing at the idea of a resurrection</li>
<li>1 Corinthians 15 starts by addressing this problem</li>
<li>Ends up with one of the clearest presentations of the “New Creation” in the Bible</li></ul>
</div>
<h2>1 Corinthians 15:1–50</h2>
<ol type="1" style="list-style-type:decimal;"><li>Now I want to make clear for you, brothers and sisters, the gospel
<ul><li>that I preached to you,</li>
<li>that you received</li>
<li>and on which you stand,</li>
<li><sup style="font-size:8px;">2.</sup>and by which you are being saved, (if you hold firmly to the message I preached to you—unless you believed in vain.)</li></ul></li>
<li value="3">For I passed on to you as of first importance what I also received—
<ul><li>that Christ <span class="purple">died</span> for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,</li>
<li><sup style="font-size:8px;">4.</sup>and that he was <span class="purple">buried</span>,</li>
<li>and that he was <span class="purple">raised</span> on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,<br />
…</li></ul></li>
<li value="21" id="v51">For just as <strong>death</strong> came through <span class="purple">a human</span>, <br />
      —the <strong>resurrection</strong> of the dead also came through <span class="purple">a human</span>.</li>
<li>For just as in <span class="purple">Adam</span> all <strong>die</strong>, <br />
      —so also in <span class="purple">Christ</span> all will be made <strong>alive</strong>.<br />
…</li>
<li value="45" id="v45">So also it is written, “The first man, Adam, became a <span style="color:#00C000; font-weight:bold">living being</span>”; the last Adam became a <span class="purple">life-giving spirit</span>.</li>
<li>However, the <span class="purple">spiritual</span> did not come first, but the <span style="color:#00C000; font-weight:bold">natural</span>, and then the <span class="purple">spiritual</span>.</li>
<li>The <span style="color:#00C000; font-weight:bold">first man</span> is from the <span style="color:#00C000; font-weight:bold">earth</span>, made of <span style="color:#00C000; font-weight:bold">dust</span>; the second man is from <span class="purple">heaven.</span></li>
<li>Like the one made of <span style="color:#00C000; font-weight:bold">dust</span>, so too are those <span style="color:#00C000; font-weight:bold">made of dust</span>, and like the one from <span class="purple">heaven</span>, so too those who are <span class="purple">of heaven</span>.</li>
<li>And just as we have borne the image of the <span style="color:#00C000; font-weight:bold">man of dust</span>, let us also bear the image of the <span class="purple">man of heaven</span>.</li>
<li>Now this is what I am saying, brothers and sisters: <span style="color:#00C000; font-weight:bold">Flesh and blood</span> cannot inherit the <span class="purple">kingdom of God</span>, nor does the <span style="color:#00C000; font-weight:bold">perishable</span> inherit the <span class="purple">imperishable</span>.</li></ol>
<p style="text-align:right;font-size:small;color:#ccc">NET Bible, plus revisions by AMF</p>
<hr />

<ul><li class="bluepoints">Read first section (v.1–4)
<ul><li>This is <mark>the core of the gospel that saves you</mark></li>
<li>Paul: “this is so fundamental it is like ABC”</li></ul></li>
<li class="bluepoints">Read v.21–22
<ul><li>He begins to set up two contrasting systems, which will form the basis for the rest of the passage</li></ul></li>
<li class="bluepoints">Now maybe you can begin to see the connection with my paper and metal?
<ul><li>Paul is giving us two categories here:</li></ul></li></ul>
<div class="slide"><h2>The Two Creations</h2>
<table class="borders headtop"><thead>
<tr>
<th>Old Creation </th>
<th>New Creation </th></tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>Adam </td>
<td>Christ </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Dust </td>
<td>the Spirit </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Perishable </td>
<td>Imperishable </td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<ul><li>How can we be made of the Holy Spirit?</li></ul>
</div>
<ul><li class="bluepoints">Adam was made of dust
<ul><li>atoms and molecules of this universe</li>
<li>Our bodies are the same basic stuff as the world around us</li>
<li>I am made of this same stuff</li>
<li>and when I die, I return to dust</li></ul></li>
<li class="bluepoints">Jesus was raised in the Spirit
<ul><li>a new kind of material</li></ul></li>
<li class="bluepoints">How can we be made of the Holy Spirit?
<ul><li>Well of course we don’t become God</li>
<li>As we will see in a moment, the Scriptures clearly teach it</li>
<li>So what does it mean?</li></ul></li>
<li class="bluepoints">If I was to visit London, England and collect a bag of rocks from the city
<ul><li>When I returned if I made the rocks into a little sculpture</li>
<li>I couldn’t say “this sculpture <mark>is</mark> the city of London”</li>
<li>I could only say “its made of the same stuff as London</li></ul></li>
<li class="bluepoints">Similarly our New Creation identities are made of the stuff of the Spirit</li></ul>
<div class="slide"><h2>New Creation and the Spirit</h2>
<ul><li>John 3:6 That which is born of the <mark>flesh</mark> is <mark>flesh</mark>, and that which is born of the <mark>Spirit</mark> is <mark>spirit</mark>.</li>
<li>Rom 1:4 who was appointed the Son-of-God-in-power according to the <mark>Holy Spirit</mark> by the resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.</li>
<li>Rom 8:11 If the <mark>Spirit</mark> of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who <mark>raised Christ Jesus</mark> from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his <mark>Spirit</mark> who dwells in you.</li></ul>
</div>
<ul><li class="bluepoints">but as we said before, these two kinds of stuff are completely different
<ul><li>if we are made of one, what do we have to do with the other?</li>
<li>how do we get from one to the other?
<ul><li>from perishable dust, to immortal Spirit?</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li class="bluepoints">The new creation has already begun, but the old is still here.</li>
<li>Our main problem comes from the fact we are living in both at the same time</li></ul>

<h2 class="point">2. Getting from the Old to the New</h2>
<ul><li>Definition of a Christian: <mark>in Christ</mark></li>
<li class="bluepoints">So how to we get from the old to the new?
<ul><li>You can’t suddenly discover that your leg is part of the New Creation</li>
<li>the answer is by being <mark>joined to Jesus who made the transition</mark></li>
<li>we died <mark>with</mark> him and are being raised <mark>with</mark> him</li>
<li>we are united to him</li></ul></li>
<li>Being United with Jesus is the answer to almost every question!
<ul><li>If you have ever taught children in Sunday School... “Jesus!”</li></ul></li></ul>

</div>
<div class="slide"><h2></h2>
</div>
<ul><li class="bluepoints">So how do we get this?
<ul><li>Jesus offers it to us freely. “Come to me that you may have life”</li>
<li>It is a death and a life.
<ul><li>Jesus, I want the old me to die so I can have your gift of the new me</li>
<li>All our sin and guilt is taken away in his death.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

<div class="slide"><h2>Colossians 2 &amp; 3</h2>
<ol type="1" style="list-style-type:decimal;"><li value="12">Having been buried with him in baptism, you also have been raised with him through your faith in the power of God who raised him from the dead.</li>
<li value="1">Therefore, if you have been raised with Christ, keep seeking <mark>the things above</mark>, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.</li>
<li>Keep thinking about <mark>things above</mark>, not <mark>things on the earth</mark>,</li>
<li>for <mark>you have died</mark> and <mark>your life is hidden with Christ</mark> in God.</li>
<li>When Christ (who is your life) <mark>appears</mark>, then <mark>you too will be revealed</mark> in glory with him.</li></ol>
