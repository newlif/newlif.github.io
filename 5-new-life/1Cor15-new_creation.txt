-Today I want to explore:
{Explore:
How being in the New Creation/
because we are united to Christ/
changes everything
}
-Get out metal and paper

{Recap
1. What God is like
2. God and the Spirit World
3. How the World got Broken
}

{4. How the cross and resurrection changed everything
1. Solution: The New Creation
2. How it works: Union with Christ Col 2:8-23
3. What this means for us
}

{5. New Life in Christ
1. The Two Creations
2. Getting from the Old to the New
3. Living in the New
}

{Two Kinds of Stuff
1. Things made out of paper, card, tape & glue
2. Things made out of metal
-Characteristics?
-Can you turn something from card to metal?
-How would you go about doing this?
-_So what was that all about Andrew?_
}

1. Paper & Card
 -does not last
 -easily damaged
 -not strong
 -can burn

2. Metal
 -lasts indefinitely
 -resists damage
 -very strong and functional
 -cannot burn

-No you can't!
 -Have to start again and copy it

-So what is that all about 

{Problem at Corinth
-There was a problem that some people at the Corinthian church were laughing at the idea of a resurrection
-1 Corinthians 15 starts by addressing this problem
-Ends up with one of the clearest presentations of the "New Creation" in the Bible
}

$iframe 1Cor15-iframe "1 Corinthians 15"
$iframecopy

-Read first section (v.1-4)
 -This is ^the core of the gospel that saves you^
 -Paul: "this is so fundamental it is like ABC"

$if $LONGVERSION //also have to edit 1Cor15-iframe to include the whole passage 
-Read v.14-19
 -He goes through the implications if Jesus was not raised
$endif

-Read v.21-22
 -He begins to set up two contrasting systems, which will form the basis for the rest of the passage

$if $LONGVERSION //also have to edit 1Cor15-iframe to include the whole passage 
-Read v.23-27
 -The order of future events

-We'll skip a few verses where he talks more about how absurd it would be to be a Christian and not believe in the resurrection
 -Read v.32

-Now the next section introduces the difference between the ^Old Creation^ and the ^New Creation^
 -Two analogies given:
  -Read v.36-38 --The difference is like that between the seed that is sown and what springs up
  -Read v.39-41 --The difference is like that between vastly different objects
 -He brings them together in v.42-44
  -We die as one kind, and are raised as the other
$endif

-Now maybe you can begin to see the connection with my paper and metal?
 -Paul is giving us two categories here:

{The Two Creations
----t
| Old Creation | New Creation |
| Adam | Christ |
| Dust | the Spirit |
| Perishable | Imperishable |
----
-How can we be made of the Holy Spirit?
}

-Adam was made of dust
 -atoms and molecules of this universe
 -Our bodies are the same basic stuff as the world around us
 -I am made of this same stuff
 -and when I die, I return to dust

-Jesus was raised in the Spirit
 -a new kind of material

-How can we be made of the Holy Spirit?
 -Well of course we don't become God
 -As we will see in a moment, the Scriptures clearly teach it
 -So what does it mean?

-If I was to visit London, England and collect a bag of rocks from the city
 -When I returned if I made the rocks into a little sculpture
 -I couldn't say "this sculpture ^is^ the city of London"
 -I could only say "its made of the same stuff as London

-Similarly our New Creation identities are made of the stuff of the Spirit

{New Creation and the Spirit
-John 3:6 That which is born of the ^flesh^ is ^flesh^, and that which is born of the ^Spirit^ is ^spirit^. 
-Rom 1:4 who was appointed the Son-of-God-in-power according to the ^Holy Spirit^ by the resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord. 
-Rom 8:11 If the ^Spirit^ of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who ^raised Christ Jesus^ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his ^Spirit^ who dwells in you. 
}

-but as we said before, these two kinds of stuff are completely different
 -if we are made of one, what do we have to do with the other?
 -how do we get from one to the other?
  -from perishable dust, to immortal Spirit?

-The new creation has already begun, but the old is still here.
-Our main problem comes from the fact we are living in both at the same time

3. Living in the New
}
$P 2. Getting from the Old to the New
-Definition of a Christian: ^in Christ^

-So how to we get from the old to the new?
 -You can't suddenly discover that your leg is part of the New Creation
 -the answer is by being ^joined to Jesus who made the transition^
 -we died ^with^ him and are being raised ^with^ him
 -we are united to him
-Being United with Jesus is the answer to almost every question!
 -If you have ever taught children in Sunday School... "Jesus!"

-So how do we get this?
 -Jesus offers it to us freely. "Come to me that you may have life"
 -It is a death and a life.
  -Jesus, I want the old me to die so I can have your gift of the new me
  -All our sin and guilt is taken away in his death.

{Colossians 2 & 3
12. Having been buried with him in baptism, you also have been raised with him through your faith in the power of God who raised him from the dead.
1. Therefore, if you have been raised with Christ, keep seeking ^the things above^, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. 
2. Keep thinking about ^things above^, not ^things on the earth^, 
3. for ^you have died^ and ^your life is hidden with Christ^ in God. 
4. When Christ (who is your life) ^appears^, then ^you too will be revealed^ in glory with him. 
}

-So what practical difference does it make?
-Our second main passage today is Romans 6

$h3_style1=font-size:100%; margin:0;
$iframe Rom6-parallel-iframe "Romans 6:5-14"
$iframecopy

-Go through and point out comparison
 -Christ's story has become our story

{Two Differences in the New
1. We don't need to live as if we were slaves to sin. We are free now that we are under grace!
2. Jesus now lives in us through the Spirit
}
-Is it the Spirit in us or Jesus--amounts to the same thing
 -The Spirit is the channel of Jesus

{Galatians 2
19. For through the law ^I died^ to the law so that I may live to God. 
20. I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but ^Christ lives in me^. So the life I now live in the body, I live because of the faithfulness of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. 
}
-Once again, this is the New Creation life within us

-God has put a piece of eternity inside us.
 -You are called to live out of this new reality
-Every bit of the love of Jesus you show for another person is made of the stuff of eternity
 -Nothing you do for God will be lost
 -This will survive till the end of time

-I have spend a lot of hours of hard work in my workplace this week
 -Is that just paper and card?
 -That doesn't mean it is worthless building them--If you do it to God's glory, everything has eternal value

{Romans 7:6
"But now we have been released from the law,/
because we have died to what controlled us, /
so that we may serve in ^the new life of the Spirit^/
and not under the old written code."
}

-The name of our church comes from this truth!

{New Life in Christ - recap
1. The Two Creations
2. Getting from the Old to the New
3. Living in the New:
 -*We are no longer slaves to the old behaviour, but free to live in the new*
 -*We have the very life of God working in us through the Spirit*
}

{Romans 8:13-16
13. $...but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body you will live.
14. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God.
15. For you did not receive the spirit of slavery leading again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, "Abba, Father."
16. The Spirit himself bears witness to our spirit that we are God's children.
}

-We live out of our self image. We must live out of this--the new us
 -So that way we respond to this is by grasping our new identity and living out of it.
