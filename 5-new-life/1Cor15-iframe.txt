1. Now I want to make clear for you, brothers and sisters, the gospel
 -that I preached to you,
 -that you received
 -and on which you stand, 
 -~2.~and by which you are being saved, (if you hold firmly to the message I preached to you—unless you believed in vain.)
3. For I passed on to you as of first importance what I also received—
 -that Christ ^died^ for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, 
 -~4.~and that he was ^buried^,
 -and that he was ^raised^ on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,/

14. And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is futile and your faith is empty. 
15. Also, we are found to be misrepresenting God, because we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead, when in reality he did not raise him, if indeed the dead are not raised. 
16. For if the dead are not raised, then not even Christ has been raised. 
17. And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is useless; you are still in your sins. 
18. Furthermore, those who have fallen asleep in Christ have also perished. 
19. For if only in this life we have hope in Christ, we should be pitied more than anyone.

20. <a name="v20" />But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.

21. For just as *death* came through ^a human^, /
$IN --the *resurrection* of the dead also came through ^a human^. 
22. For just as in ^Adam^ all *die*, /
$IN --so also in ^Christ^ all will be made *alive*./

23. But each in his own order:
 -Christ, the firstfruits;
 -then when Christ comes, those who belong to him. 
 -~24.~Then comes the end, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father,
  -when he has brought to an end all rule and all authority and power. 
  -~25.~For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. 
 -~26.~The last enemy to be eliminated is death. 
  -~27.~For God has put everything in subjection under his feet.

32.  What do I gain if, humanly speaking, I fought with beasts at Ephesus? If the dead are not raised, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."

36. …What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.
37. And what you sow is not the body that is to be, but a bare seed—perhaps of wheat or some other grain. 
38. But God gives it a body just as he planned, and to kind of seed a body of its own. 
39. For not all flesh is the same: People have one flesh, animals have another, birds and fish another. 
40. And there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. The glory of the heavenly body is one sort and the earthly another. 
41. There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars, for star differs from star in glory. 
42. So it is with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable, what is raised is imperishable. 
43. It is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. 
44. It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.

45. So also it is written, "The first man, Adam, became a @living being@"; the last Adam became a ^life-giving spirit^. 
46. However, the ^spiritual^ did not come first, but the @natural@, and then the ^spiritual^. 
47. The @first man@ is from the @earth@, made of @dust@; the second man is from ^heaven.^ 
48. Like the one made of @dust@, so too are those @made of dust@, and like the one from ^heaven^, so too those who are ^of heaven^. 
49. And just as we have borne the image of the @man of dust@, let us also bear the image of the ^man of heaven^. 
50. Now this is what I am saying, brothers and sisters: @Flesh and blood@ cannot inherit the ^kingdom of God^, nor does the @perishable@ inherit the ^imperishable^.
