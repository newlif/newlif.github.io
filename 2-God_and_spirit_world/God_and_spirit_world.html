<ol type="1" style="list-style-type:decimal;"><li value="16">I do not cease to give thanks for you, remembering <mark>you</mark> in my prayers, <sup style="font-size:60%;">17</sup>that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, <mark>may give you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him</mark>,</li>
<li value="18">having the <mark>eyes of your hearts enlightened</mark>, that you may know <mark>what is the hope to which he has called you</mark>, what are the <mark>riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints</mark>,</li>
<li>and what is the <mark>immeasurable greatness of his power toward us</mark> who believe, according to the working of his great might <sup style="font-size:60%;">20</sup>that he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places,</li>

<li>Demon posession is real</li>
<li>Persecution and killing of Christians today is at an all-time high in the world</li></ul>
</div>
<div class="slide"><h2>Resisting the Devil</h2>
<ul><li>His main weapon is lies and deception</li>
<li>He tries to take advantage of our weaknesses</li>
<li>We need each other’s prayers and support</li>
<li>He particularly tries to bring conflict and disunity</li></ul>

<h2 class="point">3. Evil &amp; Suffering—It’s Origin &amp; Destiny</h2>
<div class="slide"><h2>The Origin of Evil</h2>
<ul><li>We are not told much at all, so we should not speculate</li>
<li>The Devil was originally obedient but rebelled in pride and led the fallen angels (=demons)</li>
<li>When this happened or where the evil came from we are not told</li>
<li>We are told much more about God’s plans to eradicate evil</li></ul>
</div>
<div class="slide"><h2>God’s Ultimate Plan to Eradicate Evil &amp; Suffering</h2>
<ul><li>If God is all-powerful, then how can evil and suffering exist?</li>
<li>The real question is does God care?
<ul><li>Yes, he has an ultimate plan to get rid of evil forever</li>
<li>What we see around us is part of the process
<ul><li>The world is in rebellion—it is actually us who have done this</li></ul></li>
<li>God is going to re-make the entire universe without pain or suffering</li></ul></li>
<li>That ultimately leaves just one question: Why the delay?</li>
<li>The cost to God is immense—we just have to trust him</li></ul>
</div>
<ul><li class="bluepoints">I can’t answer that definitively, but part of the answer I believe is that God has to allow evil to fully reveal itself so that he can utterly abolish it
<ul><li>Story of the wheat and the poisonous weeds</li></ul></li>
<li>Our response is to believe and trust
<ul><li>But also be part of the plan to defeat evil</li>
<li>We are actually the front-line soldiers in this battle</li>
<li>Our main weapon is the weapon that Jesus demonstrated on the cross
<ul><li>Love, even for our enemies</li>
<li>It was unforgiveness that Paul said gave a foothold for the devil</li>
<li>We cannot do this in our own strength—we need to be connected with the source of love</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>“Father forgive them” Jesus &amp; Stephen</li></ul>

<ul><li><mark>Have hope for the future, and motivation for the present</mark></li></ul></li></ol>
</div>

<h2 class="point">Our Response</h2>
<div class="indent"><ul><li>If you do not have God as your father, then you are in extreme danger
<ul><li>Don’t stop seeking him until you know that you have found him</li></ul></li>
<li>There is a perfect responses for the Christian in 1 John 4, but first:</li></ul></div>
<div class="slide"><h2>C.S. Lewis wrote</h2>
<p>“There are two equal and opposite errors into which our race can fall about the devils. One is to disbelieve in their existence. The other is to believe, and to feel an excessive and unhealthy interest in them. They themselves are equally pleased by both errors, and hail a materialist or magician with the same delight”<br />

<div class="slide"><h2>1 John 4</h2>
<ol type="1" style="list-style-type:decimal;"><li value="3">…This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming and now is in the world already. <sup style="font-size:60%;">4</sup>….you are from God and have overcome them, for <mark>he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.</mark>…</li>
<li value="7">Beloved, let us <mark>love one another</mark>, for love is from God, and <mark>whoever loves has been born of God</mark> and knows God.</li>
<li>Anyone who does not love does not know God, because <mark>God is love</mark>. <sup style="font-size:60%;">9</sup>In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him.…</li>
<li value="11">Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. <sup style="font-size:60%;">12</sup>…<mark>if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us</mark>.</li></ol>
