Braden notes from Jan 2019
- One hour interview if you want to be a member where you will share testimony, the
gospel, and what it means to be a member
- Welcomed in front of the church
- Family metaphor – commitment to the family
 - A key part of this is mentorship
   -Meet at least once a month to talk about spiritual life

- If you want to be / are a member, what is stopping you from attending a home group,
because just Sundays is not enough
- If you want to serve at Nlife ie. Worship, greeting, kids, etc. you should attend a home
group (if you can’t, how can we make it work for you)

- Members are expected to come on time – explain why
- Course:
 - Basic theology about being a Christian, about Newlife, and about membership
 - Three classes
 - Guinea pig on current “members”, do one class
 - Video tape first sessions, then we can potentiallywatch them with new members
- 18-30 minutes of dense material x 3 meetings, discussion throughout the material,
Andrew will provide by Feb 28 (written hand outs), need to determine title of this, aim to
do guinea pig one session in the second half of March, full sessions in May

..B. Our distinctive beliefs at Newlife

-The purpose of the church is to make disciples and develop them to maturity
 -The church has a responsibility to recognize, train, mentor and give opportunity for the exercise of gifts
 -The church is also responsible to support and encourage character growth into the image of Christ

-There are three aspects to the work of the Spirit
 A. Love
 B. Truth
 C. Power

A. Love towards God, one another and the unsaved
 -Experiencing God's love and loving him in return is at the heart of all we do
 -It is by our love for one another that the world knows we follow Jesus, and almost all the gifts are to be used in this context
 -We develop this by an extended time together on Sundays and meeting in homegroups and other events during the week
 -We are designed to be the primary manifestation of God's love to a lost world

B. The truth keeps us on track and sets us free
 -In an age of confusion and deception among Christians, we have a high value on persuing a clear understanding of God's truth, and being obedient to it
 -Our preaching, teaching and discussions take the Bible as God's authoratitive word

C. Power
 -Every person has equal access to God and empowerment to pray, not two or more levels
 -The supernatural did not end in Acts, but is important for today
 -We look to see God move in power, both as an encouragement to us and as a witness to those outside
 -Every person's gifts are needed, and are used primarily in the church community

-Church Life
 -Baptism and Breaking Bread
 -Men and Women in God's plan
 -Team leadership of the church

---
..C. Membership of the Newlife Church family

-What is a Church?
 -Not a building, or even a random collection of believers, but a family of Christians who put into practice the model that God has given us
 -God puts a very high value on church families, from the beginnng of Acts through to Jesus's letters to the churches in Revelation
 -It is his primary tool for the extension of the kingdom and the demonstration of his love until he returns.

-Why join the family?
 -Without some level of commitment, it is hard to truly function as a family.
 -This commitment forms the basis for accountability and development of giftings

-Serving
 -There will be expectation and opportunity to serve for everyone, with flexibility for circumstances (e.g. new mothers)

-Accountability
 -Commitment works both ways
 -If you are committed to us, you will...
 -Our commitment to you is to give you our attention in caring for your soul and developing you as a person
 -Mentorship: Meet at least once a month to talk about spiritual life
 -Church discipline

-Homegroup
 -This is an important part of being a member
 -If there are practical issues, we want to do whatever we can to make this possible (noting that there might be some seasons where a full attendance is problematic)

-Financial support
 -Whatever one's income
 -Our position on tithing (not a legalistic 10%, but it's a good starting point)

-Process
- One hour interview if you want to be a member where you will share testimony, the gospel, and what it means to be a member
- If not baptized, then we would like to facilitate this
- Welcomed in front of the church
