<h1>How the cross and resurrection changed everything</h1>

<h3>— <em>Colossians 2:8–23</em> — Andrew Fountain: May 26, 2019</h3>
<div class="slide"><h2>Goal</h2>
<p>That you get a really firm grasp of the single most important idea in the whole of Christianity.</p>
</div>
<ul><li>I didn’t understand this at all until 15 years after I became a Christian and it changed my Christian life.</li>
<li class="bluepoints">But first a recap:</li>
<li>Summary of last three sermons</li></ul>
<div class="slide"><h2>1. What God is like</h2>
<ol type="1" style="list-style-type:decimal;"><li>How God is different to us</li>

<div class="slide"><h2>3. How the World got Broken</h2>
<ul><li>Virtually everyone will agree that something has gone very wrong with this world…</li></ul>

<li>How it works: Union with Christ Col 2:8–23</li>
<li>What this means for us</li></ol>
</div>
<div class="slide"><h2>How the World got Broken</h2>
<ul><li>The universe was beautifully and carefully constructed</li>
<li>A place of order, harmony, beauty and perfect love, but surrounded by chaos</li>
<li>The first human’s task was to spread this harmony over the whole earth</li>
<li>The stability of this reality depended on them maintaining their allegiance to God</li>
<li>This enabled his life to be constantly flowing into them</li>
<li>They were given a very simple thing to mark their allegiance—don’t eat from a particular tree</li></ul>
</div>
<ul><li class="bluepoints">Very important point—it was not eating this fruit that was the problem in itself,
<ul><li>it was a symbol of stepping out of dependence, which broke the flow of order, love, harmony &amp; power</li></ul></li>
<li class="bluepoints">Another being in the universe came onto the scene and suggested to them that
<ul><li>God did not have their best interests</li>
<li>He could not be trusted</li>
<li>They did not need him anyway</li></ul></li>
<li class="bluepoints">The choice can by symbolized like this</li></ul>
<div class="slide imgslide"><h2>Outside God’s Will</h2><a href="../3-Fall/outside_will.png"><img src="../3-Fall/outside_will.png" alt="Outside God's Will" title="Outside God's Will" /></a>
</div>
<ul><li class="bluepoints">This sums up sin, and in a simple picture applies to every choice we have</li>
<li class="bluepoints">When Eve and Adam made this choice, it broke the carefully constructed universe they were in
<ul><li>We don’t understand the details, but the harmony was smashed, and this extended to the animal and plant kingdom as well</li></ul></li>
<li>Led to shame
<ul><li>Led most of all to a broken relatinship with God which resulted in brokenness everywhere</li>
<li>But there is still beauty everywhere</li></ul></li>
<li class="bluepoints">Problem is often framed in terms of individial sin
<ul><li>Story of teaching kids in my early 20’s – scales</li></ul></li></ul>
<div class="slide imgslide"><h2>Scales</h2><a href="scales.png"><img src="scales.png" alt="Scales" title="Scales" /></a>
<p><small>Image source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Johnny-automatic-scales-of-justice.svg">johnny</a></small></p>
</div>
<ul><li class="bluepoints">But I had a problem finding very many verses that expressed it like this
<ul><li>By his stripes we are healed” -Is 53:5</li></ul></li>
<li>So how does the Bible most commonly frame the problem and the solution?</li></ul>
<div class="slide"><h2>How the cross and resurrection changed everything</h2>
<ul><li>How the World got Broken (recap)</li></ul>
<ol type="1" style="list-style-type:decimal;"><li>Solution: The New Creation</li>
<li>How it works: Union with Christ Col 2:8–23</li>
<li>What this means for us</li></ol>
</div>

<h2 class="point">1. Solution: The New Creation</h2>
<div class="slide"><h2>The Plan</h2>
<ul><li>The whole fabric of the universe is now damaged</li>
<li>It is beyond simply patching up.</li>
<li>To rescue us God has to do something radical.</li>
<li>The plan is this: God would make an entirely new kind of reality that is perfect, and invite everyone to become part of it.</li>
<li>“The new creation”</li></ul>
</div>
<ul><li class="bluepoints">God offers to freely give us this new life.
<ul><li>Just as we entered <em>this world</em> by being born,
<ul><li>we enter the <em>new reality</em> with a new kind of “birth”.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>Jesus called this new creation the “Kingdom of God”. He explained this to a man who came to him:</li></ul>
<div class="slide"><h2>New Creation/Kingdom – John 3</h2>
<ol type="1" style="list-style-type:decimal;"><li value="3">“I tell you the truth, unless a person is born from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”
<ul><li><span class="notes">The man was confused by this and replied</span></li></ul></li>
<li>“How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter his mother’s womb and be born a second time, can he?”
<ul><li><span class="notes">Jesus explained that this creation begins inside us in an invisible way—it is “spirit” rather than physical.</span></li></ul></li>
<li value="6">“What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.</li>
<li>Do not be amazed that I said to you, ‘You must all be born from above.’”</li></ol>
</div>
<div class="slide"><h2>Two Creations</h2>
<ul><li>We have bodies of flesh because we are born into <em>this</em> world.</li>
<li>We enter the new reality by being “born from above”</li>
<li>God puts his Spirit in us, making us his children. <em>(more about this next week)</em></li>
<li>Right now this new reality is just inside us, <mark>but one day the physical world will also be renewed.</mark></li></ul>
</div>
<ul><li class="bluepoints">Jesus taught that when this world comes to an end,
<ul><li>those who are part of his new creation will receive new bodies,</li>
<li>like the new butterfly emerging from the old cocoon.</li>
<li>Sickness, suffering and death will be gone forever.</li></ul></li></ul>
<div class="slide"><h2>How did Jesus do it?</h2>
<ul><li>Jesus came from heaven taking on a human body,</li>
<li>died in his physical body,</li>
<li>and then was raised from the dead as the very first human of the new creation.</li>
<li>That is why he was called “the firstborn from the dead” <em>Rev 1:5</em></li>
<li>If we are joined to him, <mark>the same thing happens to us</mark></li></ul>
</div>
<div class="slide"><h2>How the cross and resurrection changed everything</h2>
<ul><li>How the World got Broken (recap)</li></ul>
<ol type="1" style="list-style-type:decimal;"><li>Solution: The New Creation</li>
<li>How it works: Union with Christ Col 2:8–23</li>
<li>What this means for us</li></ol>
</div>

<h2 class="point">2. How it works: Union with Christ Col 2:8–23</h2>
<div class="slide"><h2>Outline of 2:8–23</h2>
<ul><li>(8–10) Beware of being cheated—because you have everything
<ul><li>(11–14) <mark>United with Christ</mark></li></ul></li>
<li>(15–23) So don’t be cheated—because you have everything</li></ul>

<p><a href="5-Col2_8-23-text.html">Colossians 2:8–23</a></p>
<ul><li class="bluepoints">The heart of this passage:</li></ul>
<div style="border:1px solid black;">
<ol type="1" style="list-style-type:decimal;"><li value="11"><span class="darkblue"><u>In him you were</u></span> also <mark>circumcised</mark> <br />
      with a <mark>circumcision</mark> made without hands, <br />
      in stripping off the <mark>body of the flesh</mark>, <br />
<span class="darkblue"><u>in</u></span> the <mark>circumcision</mark> of Christ,<br />
 </li>
<li><mark>buried</mark> <span class="darkblue"><u>together with him</u></span> in baptism, <br />
in whom you were also <mark>raised</mark> <span class="darkblue"><u>together with him</u></span> <br />
      through faith in the working of God, who <mark>raised</mark> him from the <mark>dead</mark>.</li>
<li>And you, being <mark>dead</mark> in your <strong>trespasses</strong> and the uncircumcision of your <strong>flesh</strong>, <br />
he <mark>made alive</mark> <span class="darkblue"><u>together with him</u></span>, <br />
 <br />
<strong>forgiving</strong> us all <strong>trespasses</strong>,</li>
<li>      <strong>wiping out</strong> the <strong>record of debt</strong> against us with its <strong>decrees</strong>, <br />
      that which was <strong>hostile</strong> to us, even this he has <strong>set aside</strong>, <br />
<mark>nailing</mark> it to the <mark>cross</mark>.</li></ol>
</div>

<h4>Explain the verses</h4>
<ul><li class="bluepoints">death pictured as circumcision
<ul><li>Even in the Old Testament, circumcision was a picture of a new beginning</li>
<li>It was done on the “8th day”, the first day of a new week
<ul><li>picturing the start of a new creation</li></ul></li>
<li>Israel were told that their hearts were to be circumcised
<div class="indent"><ul><li>they were told this mean to have <mark>a new and living heart</mark></li></ul></div></li></ul></li>
<li class="bluepoints">bury—raised
<ul><li>death—life</li>
<li>“Together with him” Paul has actually coined new words here</li></ul></li>
<li>when someone was crucified, they would nail a list of their crimes to the cross
<ul><li>Our crimes were nailed to Jesus’s cross</li>
<li><strong>Not transferred to him, as a separate entity</strong>
<ul><li>but he put his arms around us and said “let’s do this together” and then he did it all</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li class="bluepoints">The core message of the gospel is <strong>union with Christ</strong>
<ul><li>Once I used to teach the Gospel in terms of scales</li>
<li>I once made a pair of scales to teach this to children</li>
<li>In one side goes our sin (heavy stone) and the other goes our good works (no substance)
<ul><li>Then we take the righteousness of Jesus and it balances it out</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>However much truth there is in this image, it is <strong>not</strong> how Paul presents the Gospel
<ul><li>Not a cold, legal transaction with scales,</li>
<li>but union with a living person</li></ul></li>
<li class="bluepoints">This is the same as being “born again” (=born from above)
<ul><li>The life of God is now in you</li>
<li>You are literally his child, born from him (although not a God)</li></ul></li>
<li class="bluepoints"><mark>Joined at the shoulder</mark></li>
<li>Implications of being united with Jesus
<ol type="1" style="list-style-type:decimal;"><li>Our destinies are inseparably connected
<ul><li>Story of the sinking supertanker and the helicopter
<ul><li>Let’s illustrate this with two people</li></ul></li>
<li>we are totally secure</li></ul></li>
<li>We actually have died
<ul><li>and we have been raised something <mark>else</mark></li></ul></li></ol></li></ul>
<div class="slide"><h2>How the cross and resurrection changed everything</h2>
<ul><li>How the World got Broken (recap)</li></ul>
<ol type="1" style="list-style-type:decimal;"><li>Solution: The New Creation</li>
<li>How it works: Union with Christ Col 2:8–23</li>
<li>What this means for us</li></ol>
</div>

<h2 class="point">3. What this means for us</h2>

<h4>Look at verses 8–10</h4>
<ul><li>things they have to do, rituals, ceremonies, <strong>particularly from the Old Testament</strong>
<ul><li>many of these things were not <strong>wrong in and of themselves</strong>, they just <em>belonged to a previous life</em>
<ul><li>Sorting stuff out I found an old library card from when I lived in England</li>
<li>A tax form was sent to my old address, years after I had moved here—no longer relevant</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>Look at Paul’s answer: it sounds like he is almost saying we are divine
<ul><li>He is not, of course, but we are a new kind of being</li>
<li>filled with the fullness of Christ, who <strong>is fully divine</strong></li></ul></li></ul>

<h4>Quick Look at verses 15–23</h4>
<ul><li class="bluepoints">When someone dies, all their legal obligations are wiped clean, all their convictions etc.
<ul><li>Lawsuite against a criminal is instantly dropped if he or she dies</li></ul></li></ul>
<div class="slide"><h2>The Torrey Canyon Disaster</h2>
<ul><li>18 March 1967</li></ul>
</div>
<ul><li class="bluepoints">Jesus died by crucifixion—the most painful way to die known to the Romans.
<ul><li>Yet the physical pain was nothing compared to what he suffering in his spirit.</li></ul></li>
<li>When Jesus died, he took on the guilt of a humanity in rebellion.
<ul><li>He paid the price, and brought peace with God.</li>
<li>It was what was needed for our forgiveness. That is how much Jesus loved us!</li></ul></li></ul>
<div class="slide"><h2>Romans 8</h2>
<ol type="1" style="list-style-type:decimal;"><li value="31">What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?</li>
<li>He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things?</li>
<li>Who shall bring any charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies.</li>
<li>Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us.</li>
<li><mark>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?</mark></li></ol>
</div>
<ul><li class="bluepoints">How much he loves us to do this for us!</li></ul>
